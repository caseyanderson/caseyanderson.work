## description

"In 2012 the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles’ department of Education, arranged via Madison Brookshire, donated 60 portable AM/FM radios to me. Originally purchased for a Michael Pisaro performance, they sat unused in MOCA’s basement amongst other leftover materials for years until I discovered them while preparing for a series of events. When I got them they were surrounded by a tangle of earbuds that resembled a nest. They are all the exact same make and model and strike me as a family.

Shortly before this donation I wrote my first piece explicitly for radios, <i>possible dust</i>. In <i>possible dust</i> one radio is mistuned between noise and some broadcast and, over the course of the performance, each performer attempts to locate that “tuning” on a radio by ear. Sometimes this happens immediately (at which point the piece is over), sometimes one performer hangs over after the rest of the ensemble has finished tuning, arriving at a kind of accidental solo. possible dust was the first of many pieces whose genesis came from having a large quantity of AM/FM radios on hand."
