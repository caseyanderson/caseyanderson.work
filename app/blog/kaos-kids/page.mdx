## KAOS Kids
with Elizabeth Chin and KAOS Network, Summer 2021 - present

KAOS Kids is an Afrofuturist culture school that holds free, drop-in educational activities for Leimert Park Village youth and their families. Participants flock weekly to our activation site, the sidewalk in front of KAOS Network, to learn chess, cultivate technology skills (electronics and VR), play games, and deepen their connection to their community. KAOS Kids participants leave our activations inspired to continue leveraging their creativity to pursue new ideas and contribute to the neighborhood.
