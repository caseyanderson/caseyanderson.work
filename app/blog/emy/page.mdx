## The Experimental Music Yearbook
with [John P. Hastings](https://www.johnphastings.org/), [Scott Cazan](https://scottcazan.com/), 2009 - 2019

[The Experimental Music Yearbook](https://experimentalmusicyearbook.com/) is a repository for composers, performers, and the public to glean the methods and styles of various artists working in the experimental music tradition. As the modes of experimentation in the arts change from year to year, the Experimental Music Yearbook’s annual issues painted a comprehensive, and varied, database of experimentation in music/sound.

A periodic festival accompanied the online portion of the Experimental Music Yearbook. These concerts served multiple purposes for the Yearbook: allowing the public to experience each selection as it was intended to be experienced, gathering media to supplement each issue’s contents, and most importantly, serving as the foundation for the curatorial scope of issue of the Yearbook. The editors believe that this type of art practice exists in the moment of its execution, so a public presentation of the journal’s contents is crucial.
