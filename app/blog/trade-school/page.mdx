[Trade School](https://www.gototradeschool.org/en) is an organization centered on building worker power through creative experimentation and education. Our mission is to provide affordable, accessible space for workers across communities to gather, exhibit, play, perform, teach, and learn. Founded by two design educators indebted to the radical visions of labor activism and liberation movements past and present, it is currently based on Hahamogâ€™na land in the unincorporated area now known as Altadena, California.
